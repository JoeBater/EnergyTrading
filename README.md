# EnergyTrading

Instead of XGBoost or other clever regressions, I've tuned the windows of a number of moving averages on real energy trading auction data and applied a simple multiple linear regression - the tuning of the predicted output matches ok for one day - .

Will move to add hourly trading soon.
